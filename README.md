Python audio clip mixer

Grab some bird songs from somewhere (http://www.xeno-canto.org), drop into
the intermittent directory, grab some weather and background sounds from
somewhere (http://www.freesound.org) and drop in weather and constant sound
directories. Start up the app. Instant (well, after you have the sounds)
nature atmosphere.

Configuration is currently at the top of the script.

TODO:
* weather fade in/out
* pre/post weather (drops after rain, lightning before rain)
* automatic normalization
* in code audio handling - no system call to mplayer
